# AllFiles and Force Plate Data _ No Positions are full of scratch work where I was trying to learn some of the functions in python.

# The Folder 'FinalAnimations' contains the some of the final products for this project. This work was then applied to later work designing department-original code for force plates. The purpose of this work is to assist health science students in introductory physics in visualizing forces. This was also used to design lab activities to teach impulse-momentum and projectile motion.
